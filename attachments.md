# Attachments

## Appendix 1. First example appendix

Attachments can be put to a new file. Note that there isn't really localizations with attachments.

\newpage
## Appendix 2. Second and maybe even better appendix

When starting a new appendix (2 or greater), `\newpage` needs to be added prior the section as each appendix needs to start from a new page with exception being Appendix 1. Also last line of attachment needs to have `\label{lastAppendixPage}` so that appendix page count is correct.
\label{lastAppendixPage}
